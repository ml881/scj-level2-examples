Spacecraft Example Application
=======================

This example application shows the mode change pattern from the ["Safety-critical Java level 2: motivations, example applications and issues"]{http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2512991} paper. The pattern describes how to construct applications which have distinct modes of behaviour with mode-specific tasks. 

In SCJ each mode is a `Mission` and changing between them is accomplished by a `MissionSequencer`. Each task is represented by the appropriate managed schedulable object. An SCJ Level 2 implementation has the benefit, over implementing this pattern at Level 1, of allowing persistent schedulable objects alongside the mode-specific schedulables.

The Spacecraft is a brief example of this pattern that has three modes: Launch, Cruise, and Land; and two persistent schedulables for: monitoring the craft's internal environment, and handling the craft's controls. The functionality of this program is not fully complete. Its intention is to illustrate the possible structure of programs at Level 2.

The program was compiled using the Icecap implementation of SCJ and is compatible with version 2.1.4 of the [Icecap eclipse plugin]{http://icelab.dk/download.html}.
